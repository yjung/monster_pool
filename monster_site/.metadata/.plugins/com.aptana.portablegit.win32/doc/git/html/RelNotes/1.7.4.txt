Git v1.7.4 Release Notes (draft)
================================

Updates since v1.7.3
--------------------

 * The option parsers of various commands that create new branch (or
   rename existing ones to a new name) were too loose and users were
   allowed to call a branch with a name that begins with a dash by
   creative abuse of their command line options, which only lead to
   burn themselves.  The name of a branch cannot begin with a dash
   now.

 * System-wide fallback default attributes can be stored in
   /etc/gitattributes; core.attributesfile configuration variable can
   be used to customize the path to this file.

 * "git diff" and "git grep" learned how functions and subroutines
   in Fortran look like.

 * "git log -G<pattern>" limits the output to commits whose change has
   added or deleted lines that match the given pattern.

 * "git read-tree" with no argument as a way to empty the index is
   deprecated; we might want to remove it in the future.  Users can
   use the new --empty option to be more explicit instead.

 * "git merge --log" used to limit the resulting merge log to 20
   entries; this is now customizable by giving e.g. "--log=47".

 * you can extend "git shell", which is often used on boxes that allow
   git-only login over ssh as login shell, with custom set of
   commands.

Also contains various documentation updates.


Fixes since v1.7.3
------------------

All of the fixes in v1.7.3.X maintenance series are included in this
release, unless otherwise noted.

 * "git log --author=me --author=her" did not find commits written by
   me or by her; instead it looked for commits written by me and by
   her, which is impossible.
